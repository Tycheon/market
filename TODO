The short list:

1 - Get rid of the DRY violations  -- macro
2 - Revise Result<self,errString> to Option<T> where T is an enum of the possible errors we might need to throw
... don't use String 
3 - Redo the Settings struct and implementation ... it's data that's required by other components
    but it doesn't really fit with the Stockfighter API
4 - Implement a process_order function so that main can be cleaner
6 - Error handling on encode_order
8 - Implement Graphite-like system for time-series graphing
